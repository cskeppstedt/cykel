# cykel

## Background

This is foremost a project in which I can test some of the new, cool features in .net MVC4. But it is also
meant to be used by subscribers of the bike rental service http://www.goteborgbikes.se/ if anyone is interested.
It gives a quick overview on the status of the stations, and is also meant to help if you want to know if there's
a station close to you, or to some address (using Google Maps API).

Some cool stuff inside:

 * Async
 * knockoutjs
 * signalr
